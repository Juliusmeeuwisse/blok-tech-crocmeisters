# MMM - My Music Match

My Music Match, shortened to MMM, is an online matching application where people can find other people based on their musical tastes. MMM uses the Spotify API to create playlists with the favorite songs of users when matches occur. This github page will only show a part of the application because I will only work on one feature. This feature will be the matching of users.

## Requirements
 My Music Match requires an Spotify account to work. The application implements the Spotify API. For more information on the Spotify API check the following link;

### Libraries

More information on Libraries soon. I will probably work with some of the following libraries;

## Installation

The application is still under construction, more information about installation will be updated in the near future.
